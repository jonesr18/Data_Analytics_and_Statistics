This short function can be used to quickly import a CSV file which is in standardized format
(see the file 'Example Standard CSV File.csv').

This function is useful if the data is relatively simple and can be broken down into several categories.

To use the function, simply type openStdCSV('file'), where 'file' is some CSV file on your path, 
or the full pathname + filename for it. Note that the ending '.csv' is not technically required,
but I recommend adding it nonetheless.
