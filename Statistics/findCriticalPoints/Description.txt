This function finds the critical points in a curve as requested by the user.

To use it, pass a vector (numerical array) and optional strings ('min', 'max', 'mid', or 'all') as 
inputs. If not strings are passed, the function computes local maxima by default. 

The function returns the critical points requested in the order that they were given as arguments. 
If 'all' is passed as the argument, the order is ['max', 'min', 'mid']. 

The arrays of points returned are indices which, when plugged into your time vector, will return the
times at which the minimum or maximum points occur.
