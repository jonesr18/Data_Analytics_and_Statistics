This function finds the critical points in a curve where there is a local minimum or maximum.

To use it, pass a vector (numerical array) and a string ('min', 'max', or 'both') as inputs 1 and 2.

If 'min' or 'max' are passed as the first input, then the function will directly return an array of the requested critical points. 

If 'both' is passed as the second input, then the array of max and min points will be returned as a cell array 
where the first cell contains the max points and the second contains the min points, both as arrays.

The arrays of points returned are indices which, when plugged into your time vector, will return the times
at which the minimum or maximum points occur.
